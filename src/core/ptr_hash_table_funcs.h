 * at actual hashing, so until proven otherwise, we'll "just" multiply by the
 * golden ratio and then downshift to get a bucket. This will mix in all the
 * bits of the pointer, so avoids "obvious" problems such as pointers being
 * 8 or 16 byte aligned (lots of zeros in the least significant bits)
 * similarly the potential for lots of repetition in the higher bits.
 *
 * Since we grow bucket sizes in multiples of two, we just need a right
 * bitmask to get it on the correct scale. This has an advantage over using &ing
 * or % to get the bucket number because it uses the full bit width of the hash.
 * If the size of the hashv is changed we will need to change max_hashv_div_phi,
 * to be max_hashv / phi rounded to the nearest *odd* number.
